Overview: 

Yelp Helper is designed to allow an individual to search through Yelp's publicly available database of businesses, and receive an AI-generated summary of the most helpful reviews. 
Users can register with integration to Auth0, and save businesses to try. They can also add dietary restrictions to their profile, which will be added into consideration
when generating the review summary. 

Background:

Yelp Helper was created after numerous experiences going to new restaurants and searching tirelessly through reviews on what items to try, while also
accounting for personal preferences like dietary restrictions. I wanted a streamlined way to be able to find a businesses, and receive a concise
way to digest the most helpful reviews.
