Overview: 

Yelp Helper is designed to allow an individual to search through Yelp's publicly available database of businesses, and receive an AI-generated summary of the most helpful reviews. 
Users can register with integration to Auth0, and save businesses to try. They can also add dietary restrictions to their profile, which will be added into consideration
when generating the review summary. 

Background:

Yelp Helper was created after numerous experiences going to new restaurants and searching tirelessly through reviews on what items to try, while also
accounting for personal preferences like dietary restrictions. I wanted a streamlined way to be able to find a businesses, and receive a concise
way to digest the most helpful reviews.

Stack Used:

Flask
PostgreSQL
Angular

Why This Stack?:

With Java being the langauge I had alwasy been most comfortable with, I was looking for ways to continue to learn and improve with Python. Thus, I chose
Flask for my backend to create the REST API, and also used Python for the scripts to insert the Yelp dataset into the database. I chose PostgreSQL to 
practice utilizing SQL queries learned in my database classes. I chose Angular to test new frontend frameworks and I enjoyed being able to easily generate the application
barebones using the cli tool as well as easy component creation and handling. State management was extremely intuitive. One challenge I faced was that many of the online
resources I was using followed older versions of Angular, while I was attempting to use Angular standalone which had generally less guidance online. The documentation, however,
helped me through this challenge.
